# MKV to MP4
This is a tool created for a plex server to convert all the mkv, uncompressed bad file formats for streaming,
to mp4 for better streaming performance for direct streaming.

## What does it do
Simple, looks through all the sub direcotrs in the director selected looking for mkv to then convert it to mp4, does it by changing container
of the data.


# TODO
* Make an automatic mode to search every 24hrs
* Show a percentage done of current conversion
* hide the terminal when running(build python)
